# heather-website
This is a project for helping my girlfriend organize her recipes.
Recipe websites are often flooded with ads and fluff, this is a no nonsense website that she can use to quickyly find her favorite recipes.
The homepage provides some randomly generated items that will ideally help her pick meals when she is indecisive.
It will also feature a 'Lunch Decider' that will make a random lunch decision based on provided parameters.
